#This file gives a description of my favourite physics formula

F=GmM/(r^2)

Here,
F - Gravitational force generated due to attraction between two masses
G - universal gravitational constant
m - Mass of one object
M - mass of the other object
r - distance between the centres of the two masses ; gravitational force is considered to be a central force
